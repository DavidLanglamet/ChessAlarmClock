// Check if pressing + twice quickly causes problems
// add a little v at the top of the modal to make it clear that you can swipe down and discard changes.

// Make it so that you can change settings like board theme and type of puzzle in the settings page. 
// figure out how to retrieve data off of the website to make things like stop the alarm after 3 puzzles possible.
// Figure out how to clear cache (so you don't see how many puzzles you have solved) / edit the html as needed or whatever.

// drop down zahlen zentriert. vielleicht schmaler? Farbe Ã¤ndern?
// Profile button gleich positioniert wie go back buttons
