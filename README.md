# Project Overview
This application serves as an alarm clock that can only be deactivated by solving chess puzzles. It was initially designed to be cross-platform, leveraging React Native for development. However, after running into a few design challenges with the Android version, the focus shifted primarily to iOS. As a result, the app is fully functional on iOS devices, while the Android version remains under development. A TODO list is included in the project, detailing the remaining features and functionality that need to be implemented.
